INTRO

Reconnaissance, also known as the preparatory phase, is where the hacker gathers information about a target
before launching an attack and is completed in phases prior to exploiting system vulnerabilities.
One of the first phases of Reconnaissance is dumpster diving. It is during this phase that the hacker finds valuable information such as old passwords, names of important employees (such as the head of the network department), and performs an active reconnaissance to know how the organization functions.

As a next step, the hacker completes a process called footprinting to collect data on the security posture, reduces the focus area such as finding out specific IP addresses, identifies vulnerabilities within the target system, and finally draws a network map to know exactly how the network infrastructure works to break into it easily.
Footprinting provides important information such as the domain name, TCP and UDP services, system names, and passwords.
There are also other ways to do footprinting, including impersonating a website by mirroring it, using search engines to find information about the organization, and even using the information of current employees for impersonation.
