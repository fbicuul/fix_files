To mitigate the chances of ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning, follow these DAI implementation guidelines:
• Enable DHCP snooping globally.
• Enable DHCP snooping on selected VLANs.
• Enable DAI on selected VLANs.
• Configure trusted interfaces for DHCP snooping and ARP inspection.

It  is generally advisable to configure all access switch ports as  untrusted and to configure all uplink ports that are connected to other  switches as trusted.




S1(config)# ip dhcp snooping
S1(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 10
S1(config)# ip arp inspection vlan 10
S1(config)# interface fa0/24
S1(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust
S1(config-if)# ip arp inspection trust










The ip arp inspection validate {[src-mac] [dst-mac] [ip]} global configuration command is used to configure DAI to drop ARP packets when the IP addresses are invalid. It can be used when the MAC addresses in the body of the ARP packets do not match the addresses that are specified in the Ethernet header. Notice in the following example how only one command can be configured. Therefore, entering multiple ip arp inspection validate commands overwrites the previous command. To include more than one validation method, enter them on the same command line as shown and verified in the following output.

S1(config)# ip arp inspection validate ?
dst-mac  Validate destination MAC address
  ip       Validate IP addresses
  src-mac  Validate source MAC address
S1(config)# ip arp inspection validate src-mac
S1(config)# ip arp inspection validate dst-mac
S1(config)# ip arp inspection validate ip

S1(config)# do show run | include validate
ip arp inspection validate ip 

S1(config)# ip arp inspection validate src-mac dst-mac ip

S1(config)# do show run | include validate
ip arp inspection validate src-mac dst-mac ip 
S1(config)#
