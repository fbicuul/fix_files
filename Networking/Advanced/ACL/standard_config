Standard Numbered ACLs 
ACLs only filter (permit or deny packets) at Layer 3, based only on the source IPv4 address.



Assume only PC1 is allowed out to the internet. To enable this policy, a standard ACL ACE could be applied outbound on S0/1/0, as shown in the figure.

R1(config)# access-list 10 remark ACE permits ONLY host 192.168.10.10 to the internet							
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit host 192.168.10.10																										
R1(config)# do show access-lists																																				
	Standard IP access list 10																																							
    10 permit 192.168.10.10																																								
R1(config)#																																															


Now assume that a new network policy states that hosts in LAN 2 should also be permitted to the internet. To enable this policy, a second standard ACL ACE could be added to ACL 10, as shown in the output.


R1(config)# access-list 10 remark ACE permits all host in LAN 2																				
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255																							
R1(config)# do show access-lists																																				
Standard IP access list 10																																								
    10 permit 192.168.10.10																																								
    20 permit 192.168.20.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255																											
R1(config)#   																																															


Apply ACL 10 outbound on the Serial 0/1/0 interface.


R1(config)# interface Serial 0/1/0																																				
R1(config-if)# ip access-group 10 out																																		
R1(config-if)# end																																												
R1# 																																																			



The resulting policy of ACL 10 will only permit host 192.168.10.10 and all host from LAN 2 to exit the Serial 0/1/0 interface. All other hosts in the 192.168.10.0 network will not be permitted to the internet.


R1# show  run  |  section  access-list																																		
access-list 10 remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10																									
access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.10																																			
access-list 10 remark ACE permits all host in LAN 2																										
access-list 10 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255																													
R1# 																																																			

Notice how the remarks statements are also displayed.

Finally, use the show ip interface  command to verify if an interface has an ACL applied to it. In the  example output, the output is specifically looking at the Serial 0/1/0  interface for lines that include “access list” text.


R1# show  ip  int  Serial 0/1/0  |  include access list																											
  Outgoing Common access list is not set																																
  Outgoing access list is 10																																							
  Inbound Common access list is not set																																	
  Inbound  access list is not set																																					
R1# 																																																			





Standard Named ACLs 




Assume  only PC1 is allowed out to the internet. To enable this policy, a named  standard ACL called PERMIT-ACCESS could be applied outbound on S0/1/0.

Remove the previously configured named ACL 10 and create a named standard ACL called PERMIT-ACCESS, as shown here.

R1(config)# no  access-list  10																																
R1(config)# ip  access-list  standard  PERMIT-ACCESS																			
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark  ACE permits host 192.168.10.10															
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit  host  192.168.10.10																						
R1(config-std-nacl)# 																																				


Now add an ACE permitting only host 192.168.10.10 and another ACE permitting all LAN 2 hosts to the internet.

R1(config-std-nacl)# remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10															
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.10.10																						
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark ACE permits all hosts in LAN 2																
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255																				
R1(config-std-nacl)# exit																																		
R1(config)# 																																									

Apply the new named ACL outbound to the Serial 0/1/0 interface.

R1(config)# interface  Serial 0/1/0																													
R1(config-if)# ip  access-group  PERMIT-ACCESS  out																			
R1(config-if)# end																																						
R1# 																																													

Use the show access-lists and show running-config command to review the ACL in the configuration, as shown in the output.

R1# show  access-lists																																			
	Standard IP access  list  PERMIT-ACCESS																								
    10 permit 192.168.10.10																																		
    20 permit 192.168.20.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255																					
R1# show  run  |  section  ip  access-list																											
	ip access-list standard PERMIT-ACCESS																									
 	remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10																									
 	permit 192.168.10.10																																			
 	remark ACE permits all hosts in LAN 2																										
 	permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255																														
R1# 																																													

Finally, use the show ip interface command to verify if an interface has an ACL applied to it. In the example output, the output is specifically looking at the Serial 0/1/0 interface for lines that include “access list” text.

R1# show  ip  int  Serial 0/1/0  |  include access list																					
  Outgoing Common access list is not set																										
  Outgoing access list is PERMIT-ACCESS																										
  Inbound Common access list is not set																											
  Inbound  access list is not set																															
R1# 																																													









Secure VTY ACLs



A named standard ACL called ADMIN-HOST is created and identifies PC1. Notice that the deny any has been configured to track the number of times access has been denied.

The vty lines are configured to use the local database for authentication, permit Telnet traffic, and use the ADMIN-HOST ACL to restrict traffic.


R1(config)# username ADMIN secret class
R1(config)# ip access-list standard ADMIN-HOST
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark This ACL secures incoming vty lines
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.10.10
R1(config-std-nacl)# deny any
R1(config-std-nacl)# exit
R1(config)# line vty 0 4
R1(config-line)# login local
R1(config-line)# transport input telnet
R1(config-line)# access-class ADMIN-HOST in
R1(config-line)# end
R1#

In a production environment, you would set the vty lines to only allow SSH, as shown in the example.

R1(config)# line vty 0 4
R1(config-line)# login local
R1(config-line)# transport input ssh
R1(config-line)# access-class ADMIN-HOST in
R1(config-line)# end
R1#
